get the computer move by using math random
convert moves to 0 - 1 to 0 10
divide 0-10 to 3 moves with rock paper and scissors
turn the numbers into string, it must console.log paper rock and scissors
if working proceed to next step
first create a score list, create two variables that will define user score
and computer score and increment it every win so therefore you have to set it 
into = 0 value; 
create a function that will get the userchoice 
inside the function create a prompt that will get the move of the user
return and thats it. 
next create a function called playGame that will define whether you won 
or computer won, 
create two variables and put our given functions into value,
also create a variable for result and define it inside if statements
here we create an if statement to figure out who won
make sure to define result and increment scores in every if else statement
afterwards you have to display all of the moves,who won and the score by using
alert
make sure to display the alert if the statement is true if not dont display it
if working proceed to last step

create a function that will loop the game into 5 rounds call it function
playGround use for loop statement make a research if you have to but please
try to understand it and dont just copy and paste okay!, this lesson will be
covered in the next lesson at course.
